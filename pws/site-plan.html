        Our goal is to make sure that you are always having a great time gaming! Our staff, who are also all gamers, are dedicated to helping you have those great and memorable experiences whether that is through coaching and giving you tips on how to improve your gameplay or beating that pesky and nasty level for you. Wonderfully, we can provide those services remotely in a safe manner as well! If you request help on a certain level, our staff will be able to control of the specific game you are playing and will not have access to any other parts of your device. Our non-invasive remote-play allows a staff member to control your game from another location. The process is non-invasive and easy to set up! When you set up an appointment, we will get in contact with you either through text or email with a link. Once selected, the link will direct you to a page where it will ask for specific permissions on your device. Depending on the type of service you are asking for, certain permissions will be required. The prompts will notify you if permission is required for a specific service.

        Not beating a game as a child or an adult isn’t the end of the world. It does, however, become frustrating when, you stumble across a part of a game that stops you from enjoying the rest of it, whether it be a tricky platforming level, a lack of people to play with, or that unbeatable boss whose only goal in life, it seems, is to make you feel frustrated angry and ready to quit. Why do we have to feel those things? We should be having fun with the process. ‘Having fun with the process’ is the foundation of thought for ‘Gamer Gary’. With cutting edge technology, we can beat that level that’s giving you grief or, if you’d prefer, we can coach you through beating that level with as much, or as little help, as you need. This can be done remotely or in person to your preference. If teammates for games are what you’re looking for, we can help there too! From our site, you can create a profile with your gaming platform of choice, favorite video games, and role preferences. Once that is done we will help you get connected to communities of gamers that share your same interests!

        I first came up with the idea for ‘Gamer Gary’ while I was replaying one of my favorite games from childhood. As I played through the game and finally defeated the final boss, I pondered on how I completed the game years and years before as a young boy. I remember that for the final boss of this game I had asked my father to beat him and with a few tries my father did so to my delight. Now, being older, I was able to have the patience to beat this boss after a few tries. The rewarding feeling for doing so was exhilarating! I realized though that if I had tried this same thing as a child, I would’ve gotten bored quickly of trying and failing, and picked up a new game.
